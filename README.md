A decentralized content distribution platform where each copy of the content behaves as unique entities, enabling characteristic properties and behaviors.

A defining property of the realm of atoms is that each entity is unique, and making exact replicas of an entity becomes virtually impossible. Making similar copies are energy-intesive too. This is why two paperback copies of the same book or two DVDs of the same movie are unique entities, even if the content in them are identical.

This uniqueness vanishes in the realm of bits. Two ebook files of the same book are exactly the same, and behave exactly the same way. There's no way to differentiate them.

It is this fundamental property that drives people to stand in queue for days for the 1st iPhone, while there's no queue (or any special behavior) to get the first digital copy of Fifty Shades of Grey. Atoms are scarce, bits are not.

This project is a way to build digital scarcity on to the realm of bits, while keeping the best bits (pun intended) intact.

A user who buys the book is the OWNER of the book, and he/she is able to sell/give the copy
to whomsoever, the same way one is free to give physical books to friends and family. So a book bought and read can be sold
to someone else as resale, generating revenue for the owner, the book publisher gets a cut of this transaction as well,
making it an additional stream of revenue for the publisher.

An entirely new market can be dug up from this, due to the uniqueness of the copies. Copies can be auctioned off,
and users might be interested in paying a premium for certain copies (copy #1 of Fifty Shades of Grey, for example).

Books are just a single use-case, of course. Any kind of digital content(movies, music, artwork) etc. can be made unique like this.
